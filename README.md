This repository is a tool designed to translate speech or text into sign language (either ASL - American Sign Language or ISL - Indian Sign Language) and display corresponding images of the hand signs. It uses speech recognition to convert spoken language to text, and then uses images representing the hand signs of the letters in either ASL or ISL.
